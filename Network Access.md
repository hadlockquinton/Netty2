    Encoded with ASCII by using 26 letters of the latin alphebet in both upper and lower case plus 0-9 and adding 2 special characters
#    Topologies
    BUS : A bus network is a network topology in which nodes are directly connected to a common half-duplex link called a bus.
    STAR : A central hub that everything connects together
    RING : Each node connects exactly to two nodes foring a ring
    MESH : every Node has a bride to another node
    WIRELESS : Topology that uses wireless connections to connect to AP's
    HIERARCHICAL: A core layer of high-end switches optimized for network availability and performance.
                  A distribution layer of switches implementing forwarding decisions.
                  An access layer connecting users via hubs, bridges, or switches

#    Devices 
    Hubs: Devices that allow multiple devices to connect to the same wire
    Switches: devices that allow multiples devices to connect to the network
    Repeaters: Devices that allow a connection to be extended beyond normal operational cable or wireless limits

#    Internet Timing
    Bit Time - is the period of time is required for a bit to be placed and sensed on the media. Network speeds are measured by how many bits can be placed or sensed on the media in 1 second. Each increase in speed requires more bits to be sent during the same 1 second internal. To accomplish this the bit-times are reduced.
