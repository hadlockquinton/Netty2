# Scanning nature 
    active

# Scanning strategy
    remote to local
    local to remote 
    local to local

# Scanning approach 
    Aim
        Wide range target scan
        target specific scan
    Method 
        single source scna
            1 to 1 or 1 to many
        Distributed scan
    Vertical scan : Scan some or all ports on a single target
    Horizontal scan : Scan a sinlge or set ports on a range of targets
    Strobe scan : Scan a predefined subset of ports on range of targets
    Block Scan : Scan all ports or a range of ports of targets 
    
# NMAP DEFAULTS 
    USER: TCP full scan, -sT
    ROOT: TCP syn scan -sS
